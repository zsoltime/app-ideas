# Pimon Game

Pimon game is like [Simon Says][wiki] but instead of playing with a random sequence it follows the digits of the constant π.

You can simply click on `Start` and Pimon will start flashing the digits of π, adding a new digit in each round. Once finished, it's your turn to repeat π to as many decimals as Pimon did.
