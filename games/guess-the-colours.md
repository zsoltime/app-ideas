# Guess the Colours

Don't you like CSS colour names? Some of them are so cute; just think of `papayawhip`, `peachpuff` or `cornsilk`. Have you ever heard about any of these? This game is for you then. ðŸ˜Ž

The rules are simple. You should find the colours by their name before you run out of time.
